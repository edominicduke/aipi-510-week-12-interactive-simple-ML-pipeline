We trained a Logistic Regression model on the titanic dataset. We attempted to train the model on just the ages of the passengers and predict whether said passengers survived. We achieved an accuracy score of approximately 64.33%, which demonstrates in practice that good practice is to train models on multiple features (if available in the given datasets) when it comes to binary classification tasks.
